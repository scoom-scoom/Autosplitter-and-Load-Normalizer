Measuring the ASL planet split:

black screen to ship (fisrt frame is the last time you see ratchet, last frame is the last black frame)
151 165 = 14
247 259 = 12
325 339 = 15
420 438 = 18
    532
602 633 = 31
    727


Splits (first frame where livesplit has split)
163
258
339
437
531
632
726

Conclusion: ASL file splits usually a distance of 2 frames before the ship appears frame.
TODO: Measure in 60FPS to get better accuracy.


Measuring the ASL load finished split:

First black screen to load finished debug output:
405 425 = 20
704 725 = 21
989 1010 = 21
1387 1399 = 12 (maybe this is from spamming start to skip the ryllus cutscene)
