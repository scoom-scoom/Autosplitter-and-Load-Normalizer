# The parameter crop_scale determines how large the cropped image in the centre should be.
# If it's too small, there is a chance that images with some black in the middle
# will be falsely counted as a black screen. If it is too large, there is a chance
# that the cropped image also includes pixels outside of the game video (e.g.
# twitch layout), which would most likely not be black.
